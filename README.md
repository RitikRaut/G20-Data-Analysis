Welcome to the G20 Economic and Social Data Analysis project! In this project, I explored and analyzed the economic and social data of G20 countries using data from the World Bank.
## Project Overview

In this project, I have:

1. **Collected Data:** Utilized the `wbdata` web API to gather economic and social data from the World Bank.

3. **Analyzed Data:** Applied various data analysis techniques to extract valuable insights.
4. **Visualized Data:** Created insightful visualizations to effectively communicate the findings.


This project includes the following materials:

1. **Data Collection Script:** A Python script that I created to fetch data from the World Bank using the `wbdata` API.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation Notebook:** A Jupyter notebook where I cleaned and transformed the data.
3. **Data Analysis Notebook:** A Jupyter notebook where I applied data analysis techniques.
4. **Visualization Notebook:** A Jupyter notebook where I created visualizations of the data.
